# Mathematics-for-Computer-Science
Notes and other course materials I created for a course for new grad students at Faculty of ICT, Mahidol University.

Materials are written in LaTex. 

There are files for notes and homework (with option to make solutions visible). These should by default be compiled into a master document, 
which will include homework solutions as an appendix. To compile a document without solutions just remove or comment out the appendix.

There are also files for slides and solutions for selected homework problems (created with Beamer).
